        <h2>About</h2><br>
        <p>Service workers are in need of a way to collect tips directly, rather than through their employers.
          Currently, the only method of doing this is using cash. Tipsease app will allow customers access to directly
          tip without needing to use cash or share personal information.

        <h2>Features</h2><br>
        <p>Customers can create an account/login, view a list of service workers, view their profile, and most importantly tip that service worker.<br>
          As a service worker you have the ability to make your profile (info, tagline, how many month's you've worked
          at that location, etc).</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Vision</h2><br>
        <p>Our goal is for employees to be able to quickly and easily receive their tips in a timely manner, rather than having to wait for their employer to process them. Customers will have access to tipping directly without paying fees, sharing personal information, thus reducing the risk of credit fraud.</p>
